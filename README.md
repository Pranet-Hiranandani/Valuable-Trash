## Problem Statement

Excess waste is very harmful to our environment. While there are many campaigns for this very few give practical and simple solutions. Even people who are concerned about the environment find it extremely hard to repurpose their waste. They run out of ideas and end up throwing it as trash.

- From over 300 million tonnes of plastic produced annually, around 50% of it is single-use plastic.
- More than 8 million tonnes of plastic end up into the oceans which have a horrendous impact on life in water and around it.
- Over 100,000 marine animals die every year from plastic entanglement and ingestion

## How it works

- Users hold their camera near the waste that they want to reuse.
- A machine learning algorithm classifies the waste based upon its type, material and size.
- The user gets a list of ideas to repurpose their waste with separate difficulty levels.
- An innovative solution is provided with a step-by-step tutorial on how to repurpose it. Users can follow a step-by-step tutorial to easily repurpose their waste instead of throwing it away.

## AI Model

- Dataset comprises of 100 imagegs each of Plastic Bottles, Plastic Bags, Plastic Boxes, Soda Cans, Plastic Cutlery and Plastic Glasses.
- Used the MobileNetv2 CNN model to train the dataset
- Accuracy of 92% and loss of 0.19
