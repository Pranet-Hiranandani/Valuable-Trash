## Problem Statement

Excess waste is harmful to our environment. While there are many campaigns for this very few give practical and simple solutions. Even people concerned about the environment find it extremely hard to repurpose their waste. They run out of ideas and end up throwing them as trash.

- From over 300 million tonnes of plastic produced annually, around 50% of it is single-use plastic.
- More than 8 million tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans which have a horrendous impact on life in water and around it.
- Over 100,000 marine animals die every year from plastic entanglement and ingestion.
- 9 out of 10 people said they would recycle and repurpose if it were "easier".

## How it works

- Users hold their cameras near the waste that they want to repurpose.
- A machine learning algorithm classifies the waste based on its type, material and size.
- The user gets a list of ideas to repurpose their waste with separate difficulty levels.
- An innovative solution is provided with a step-by-step tutorial on repurposing it. Users can follow a step-by-step tutorial to easily repurpose their waste instead of throwing it away.

## AI Model

- Dataset comprises 1000+ images of Plastic Bottles, Plastic Bags, Plastic Boxes, Soda Cans, Plastic Cutlery and Plastic Glasses.
- Used the MobileNetv2 CNN model to train the dataset.
- Accuracy of 92% and loss of 0.19.

## Additional Features

- The user can locate nearby Recycling centres using Google Maps.
- There is an option for the user to contribute their ideas to the Valuable Trash community.
- The user can access the latest climate change articles and tips to reduce their carbon footprint.

## Integration with Firebase

- All tutorials are stored on the cloud, using Firestore and Firebase Storage.
- Created a Python Application to easily upload new ideas and tutorials.
- Used Firebase Authentication to allow the user to sign in for a more personalised experience.
